# Predictive-Maintainance-of-Industrial-Machineries
(IBM Cloud Integrated)

##  Project Overview
This project predicts machinery failures before they occur using IoT sensor data, machine learning, and IBM Cloud services.  
It helps reduce downtime, optimize maintenance schedules, and cut costs.

##  Features
- Real-time sensor data collection (vibration, temperature, acoustic)
- Data preprocessing and feature extraction
- Machine learning models (Random Forest, LSTM, Gradient Boosting)
- IBM Watson Machine Learning deployment
- Real-time dashboard for anomaly alerts

##  Technologies Used
- Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow
- IBM Cloud, Watson Machine Learning, IBM IoT Platform
- Flask/Dash for dashboard
- MySQL / IBM Db2 on Cloud for storage
